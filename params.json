I shall attempt to put details of anything and everything I make in here :)\r\n\r\n### I'm lazy\r\nAs an Engineer I tend to be lazy and will make sure I use the least amount of time required for a task to be completed as per the requirements; which is why this is an **Automatically Generated Github Page**! Honestly I reckon it looks pretty good!\r\n\r\n### More stuff coming soon :-)\r\n",
