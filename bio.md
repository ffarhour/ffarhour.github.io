            As the only technical co-founder of Kara Technologies (<a href='https://kara.tech' target='_blank'>kara.tech</a>), I have been designing and implementing most software and hardware systems since Dec 2017. At Kara we provide scalable sign language access to digital content using digital humans and artificial intelligence.

            <p>
            My role at Kara has been two-fold: 1) to manage most of our small and multidisciplinary team to deliver projects to our clients, and 2) to design and develop our digital human driving algorithms, which smoothly produce sign language content in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
            My passions are where there are challenges to be solved. I work with people, and I evaluate a problem to find the best solution possible with the most efficiency. I am a pragmatic problem solver with a unique skillset in algorithmic design and software architecture.
