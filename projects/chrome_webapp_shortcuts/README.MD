# Chrome Web App Shortcuts
This repo is a collection of all the chrome webapps I have created to act as shortcuts to some frequently used websites.
I was bored, so decided to make them look nice.

## Note on Pictures
I do not own any rights to the pictures I have used as logos. I use them under the understanding that they are readily available and are provided by the creators of the websites themselves.

## How to get rid of the annoying chrome warning
If you directly load packages into chrome without packing them you will get the following error in the recent version of chrome:
```
" Disable Developer Mode Extensions. Extensions running in developer mode can harm your computer. If you're not a developer, you should disable these extensions running in developer mode to stay safe."
```
***SOLUTION***: To not get this message you can instead pack the packages/apps individually, and then dragging the generated *.crx* file into chrome and simply install the app.
