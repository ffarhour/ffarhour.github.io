<p>My name is Farmehr Farhour <a href="https://github.com/ffarhour" class="user-mention">@ffarhour</a> and this is my site dedicated to all my projects and creations. I shall attempt to put details of anything and everything I make in here :)</p>

<p>As an Engineer I tend to be lazy and will make sure I use the least amount of time required for a task to be completed as per the requirements; which is why this is an <strong>Automatically Generated Github Page</strong>! Honestly I reckon it looks pretty good!</p>
